function r = sor(A, b, n, w)

%SOR      Implements the successive-over-relaxation method to solve AX = B.
%         SOR(A, B, N, W) takes a relaxation parameter W, matrix A and
%         vector B and computes the iterates X for the SOR method to the
%         to the N-th iteration and returns a vector containing the âˆž-norm
%         of the residual at each iteration.
